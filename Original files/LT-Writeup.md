The Charts explore trends present on either side of the vaccination availability date to convey if there was any correlation vaccine availability had on influencing covid cases and deaths. The Plots were produced to feature a green indicator line for before and after vaccine availability.

For Nigeria, there were two trend clusters present before vaccine availability. Following vaccination availability there are also two trend clusters, It was observed that the trend clusters seen following vaccine availability appear to have decreased overall in value in comparison to the two trend clusters seen prior to vaccine availability. Conversely, sharp vertical spikes are seen following vaccine availability, a spike in covid deaths in September 2021, and a similar spike for covid cases in December 2021. 

Despite trend clusters appearing to have decreased overall following vaccine availability, two spikes with peaks that surpass the height of the prior trends contradict the cluster size decrease trend. It was assumed that the rapid spikes in cases and deaths were caused by collated entries, are such vertical trend lines unnatural?

Similarly, the United States did also see its prior vaccination covid cases trend surpass the height of the prior covid cases trend. However, the covid mortality trend height was less than the covid mortality trend before vaccine availability.

Looking at Australia, the trends are condensed from August 2021 onwards, reflecting more so the influence travel restrictions had on COVID-19 than vaccine availability.

Russia’s covid cases and covid deaths started to trend at a steady decline after vaccine availability, however, we see a trend reversal in June-July 2021. Russia’s covid deaths peaked in December 2021 and covid cases peaked in March 2021.

It is difficult to objectively interpret the influence vaccination availability had on trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths based on the data represented in the current charts alone.  

Integrating the population vaccination rate would have brought additional context to the narrative and brought out further details to assist in articulating each trend's development. 

However, we can see that the trend lines that immediately follow the vaccine availability date for Nigeria, the United States and Russia all reflect the commonality for a period of time; A decrease in Covid Cases and Deaths following the availability of the vaccine.
